I am a Physics & Astronomy Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

My interests are in the application of deep learning to physical systems, especially those in the domain of medical imaging.

My preferred languages are F#, C#, and Mathematica; however, I am proficient with MATLAB and Python.
