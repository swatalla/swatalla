I am a Physics & Astronomy Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

My interests are in the application of machine learning to physical systems, especially those in the domain of medical imaging. My current research projects specifically involve the application of deep learning in xenon CT and MR imaging.
